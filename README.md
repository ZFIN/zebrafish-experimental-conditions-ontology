# zebrafish-experimental-conditions-ontology

The zebrafish experimental conditions ontology (ZECO) is an ontology for the experimental conditions used in zebrafish research.

It was created by Yvonne M. Bradford, with help from Sabrina Toro, Sridhar Ramachandran, and Ceri Van Slyke to facilitate experimental condition annotation 
at the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN).  The ontology is a simple is_a hierarchy that is ment to represent the experimental conditions applied to zebrafish.
